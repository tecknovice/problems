Given a random set of numbers, Print them in sorted order.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
Print each sorted array in a seperate line. For each array its numbers should be seperated by space.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤A[i]<100

Example:
Input:
1
2
3 1

Output:
